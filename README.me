# PoC: Alternative to IBM DB2 Everyplace 9.1 for Synchronizing Databases

This is a **Proof of Concept (PoC)** project to develop an alternative to **IBM DB2 Everyplace 9.1** for synchronizing databases between Android and Windows devices with a central server database. The goal is to explore and implement a synchronization solution for mobile and desktop devices.

## Project Overview

IBM DB2 Everyplace 9.1 was a product that provided database synchronization between mobile devices and servers, but the goal of this PoC is to build a simplified solution to meet the similar objectives. The project focuses on:

- Database synchronization between **Android devices**, **Windows devices**, and a **server-side database**.

### Key Features:

- Synchronization between local databases on Android and Windows devices.
- Central server database acts as the source of truth for synchronization.
- Customizable conflict resolution and sync mechanisms.
- Offline support for local databases on mobile/desktop devices, syncing changes when a connection is available.

## Project History

The project was initiated and developed between **October and December 2017** as a PoC. The code was written with the intention of creating a robust synchronization solution, focusing on the mobile and desktop environments.

**Note:** The commit dates in this repository may appear incorrect due to the migration process from various Git repositories. However, the actual code was written between **October and December 2017**.
